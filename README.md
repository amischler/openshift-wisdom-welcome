openshift-wisdom-welcome
========================

This is an example of Wisdom application running on OpenShift (The RedHat PASS: https://www.openshift.com/).

# Prerequisites:

You just need an OpenShift account.

# The repository
The repository contains:

* an exploded version of the application
* two hooks to start and stop the application

To get the _exploded_ application, just take the `zip` file generated by Wisdom and unzip it. 
Then create the following structure:

```
.openshift
    action_hooks 
        start
        stop
````

The `start` and `stop` file are the OpenShift hooks.

The `start` file contains:

```
#!/bin/bash
sh $OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR/chameleon.sh -Dhttp.port=$OPENSHIFT_DIY_PORT -Dhttp.address=$OPENSHIFT_DIY_IP
```

The `stop` file contains:

```
#!/bin/bash
sh $OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR/chameleon.sh stop
```

Don't forget to add the execution permission on these files (`chmod +x *`)

Once this is done, push the project on a git repository.

# Creating the OpenShift application

1. Log in on OpenShift
2. Create a new application
3. Use the 'DIY' Cartridge
4. Give the url of your git repository

That's all!
